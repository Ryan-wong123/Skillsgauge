The School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (SPMS) at NTU Singapore hosts research and education activities in two divisions: Division of Mathematical Sciences (MAS) and Division of Physics and Applied Physics (PAP). MAS covers diverse topics ranging from pure mathematics to the applications of mathematics in cryptography, computing, business, and finance. PAP covers many areas of fundamental and applied physics, including quantum information, condensed matter physics, biophysics, and photonics. Over the years, SPMS has attracted talented individuals from around the world and Singapore to join as scientific leaders and researchers.
Position Available: Research Fellow (Engineering/Physics)
The laboratory of Yijie Shen at the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences is seeking to hire a research fellow with a solid theoretical background in optical angular momentum, particularly in vortex light fields, who has also conducted relevant research in this area. The research fellow will focus on two main aspects: 1) theoretical research on optical transverse angular momentum, and 2) the generation, measurement, and application of light fields carrying angular momentum or certain polarization states in long pulses.
Optical transverse angular momentum represents a cutting-edge topic in the field of optics. In the past three years, it has garnered significant attention and extensive research within the scientific community, with related work frequently published in top-tier journals. However, the theoretical understanding of optical transverse angular momentum is still in its infancy. The current theoretical frameworks remain unclear and lack solid foundations, with considerable discrepancies in its definition and calculation. Therefore, advancing its theoretical research is crucial, and this is expected to become a prominent research direction in optics in the coming years.
Additionally, experimental work on vortex light fields can also be pursued. While the generation and study of light beams carrying longitudinal angular momentum are already well-established, research on the generation and measurement techniques for light pulses carrying both longitudinal and transverse angular momentum is still in the early stages. Moreover, exploring potential applications of these light fields remains an open frontier. Theoretical studies involving optical vortices in pulses and ultrafast optics require further development to establish a comprehensive research framework.
Key Responsibilities:
Conduct theoretical research on optical transverse orbital angular momentum, focusing on its definition and calculation
Develop methods for numerical simulation for optical longitudinal and transverse angular momentum or generating and measuring light fields carrying longitudinal and transverse angular momentum. Investigate the practical applications of these light fields, such as using them as detection signals in various scenarios (e.g., interactions with different material interfaces)
Work on the generation and measurement of long pulses with modified power spectrum and explore their applications in the field of communications
Publish high-quality research papers to contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the field
Job Requirements:
PhD degree in Engineering, Physics or related areas, with focus on optical angular momentum, optical vortex
Experience in theoretical research for vortex beams, vector vortex beams and longitudinal/ transverse orbital angular momentum
Strong written and verbal communication skills in English is essential to conduct research
Knowledge in classical electromagnetic theory/ quantum dynamics/ optics
Background in one or more of the following topics: optical angular momentum, ultrafast optics, optical vortex
Proficiency in scientific computation in C/C++ and MATLAB
The College of Science seeks a diverse and inclusive workforce and is committed to equality of opportunity. We welcome applications from all and recruit on the basis of merit, regardless of age, race, gender, religion, marital status and family responsibilities, or disability.

The Yong research group works on novel problems in biological and statistical physics, ranging from morphological transitions, forms and shapes of things in nature, Monte Carlo simulations, molecular dynamics simulations, stochastic processes, complex networks, etc. Our approach is interdisciplinary, using a confluence of ideas from statistical physics, non-equilibrium physics, differential geometry, topology, elasticity, continuum mechanics, artificial intelligence, to algebraic topology. The PI, Yong Ee Hou, has published many high impact papers on biophysics and related topics, including Science, PNAS, and Phys. Rev. Lett., to name a few.
Understanding the structure-function relationships of biomolecules is an active area of research due to its fundamental importance in biology, physics, and engineering. Our project will seek to answer fundamental questions such as “what is the shape of a biopolymer?”, “why is a biopolymer shaped the way it is?”, “how is structure related to function?”, and provide new perspectives into the geometry and topology of a biopolymer. The results from the research will provide key insights to understanding the structure-function relationships of biomolecules.
The Yong research group is looking for a highly motivated and qualified Research Fellow with the ambition of producing high quality research that can be published in high impact journals.
The Research Fellow is expected to perform state of the art numerical simulations using computing resources from National Supercomputing Centre (NSCC) Singapore. The incumbent has freedom to design the nature and type of MC/MD simulations.
Key Responsibilities:
Utilize recently developed mathematical tools from algebraic topology, combinatorial topology, computational topology, and differential geometry (e.g., Betti numbers, Hodge-Laplacian, discrete Ricci curvature) to characterize and model the shape of biopolymers such as DNA and RNA.
Develop new simplicial models of biopolymers encoded with molecular and structural information amenable to Monte Carlo (MC) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations.
Run numerical simulations on National Supercomputing Centre (NSCC) Singapore.
