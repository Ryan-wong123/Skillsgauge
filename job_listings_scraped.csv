The School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (SPMS) at NTU Singapore hosts research and education activities in two divisions: Division of Mathematical Sciences (MAS) and Division of Physics and Applied Physics (PAP). MAS covers diverse topics ranging from pure mathematics to the applications of mathematics in cryptography, computing, business, and finance. PAP covers many areas of fundamental and applied physics, including quantum information, condensed matter physics, biophysics, and photonics. Over the years, SPMS has attracted talented individuals from around the world and Singapore to join as scientific leaders and researchers.
Position Available: Research Fellow (Engineering/Physics)
The laboratory of Yijie Shen at the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences is seeking to hire a research fellow with a solid theoretical background in optical angular momentum, particularly in vortex light fields, who has also conducted relevant research in this area. The research fellow will focus on two main aspects: 1) theoretical research on optical transverse angular momentum, and 2) the generation, measurement, and application of light fields carrying angular momentum or certain polarization states in long pulses.
Optical transverse angular momentum represents a cutting-edge topic in the field of optics. In the past three years, it has garnered significant attention and extensive research within the scientific community, with related work frequently published in top-tier journals. However, the theoretical understanding of optical transverse angular momentum is still in its infancy. The current theoretical frameworks remain unclear and lack solid foundations, with considerable discrepancies in its definition and calculation. Therefore, advancing its theoretical research is crucial, and this is expected to become a prominent research direction in optics in the coming years.
Additionally, experimental work on vortex light fields can also be pursued. While the generation and study of light beams carrying longitudinal angular momentum are already well-established, research on the generation and measurement techniques for light pulses carrying both longitudinal and transverse angular momentum is still in the early stages. Moreover, exploring potential applications of these light fields remains an open frontier. Theoretical studies involving optical vortices in pulses and ultrafast optics require further development to establish a comprehensive research framework.
Key Responsibilities:
Conduct theoretical research on optical transverse orbital angular momentum, focusing on its definition and calculation
Develop methods for numerical simulation for optical longitudinal and transverse angular momentum or generating and measuring light fields carrying longitudinal and transverse angular momentum. Investigate the practical applications of these light fields, such as using them as detection signals in various scenarios (e.g., interactions with different material interfaces)
Work on the generation and measurement of long pulses with modified power spectrum and explore their applications in the field of communications
Publish high-quality research papers to contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the field
Job Requirements:
PhD degree in Engineering, Physics or related areas, with focus on optical angular momentum, optical vortex
Experience in theoretical research for vortex beams, vector vortex beams and longitudinal/ transverse orbital angular momentum
Strong written and verbal communication skills in English is essential to conduct research
Knowledge in classical electromagnetic theory/ quantum dynamics/ optics
Background in one or more of the following topics: optical angular momentum, ultrafast optics, optical vortex
Proficiency in scientific computation in C/C++ and MATLAB
The College of Science seeks a diverse and inclusive workforce and is committed to equality of opportunity. We welcome applications from all and recruit on the basis of merit, regardless of age, race, gender, religion, marital status and family responsibilities, or disability.

A*IDL is dedicated to advancing translational research in infectious diseases to improve both health and economic outcomes.
Host Pathogen Interactions in A*STAR Infectious Diseases Labs (A*STAR ID Labs) is seeking a Postdoctoral researcher to join the lab.
Job Description:
We are seeking a talented researcher to lead the research on a 3 year funded research project as well as develop novel ideas in the broad scope of host-pathogen interactions and infectious diseases. Preliminary data gathered will help develop the researcher’s career and path to independence through the various early-career support available internally in A*STAR as well as in the Singapore ecosystem.
The funded project will aim to characterize and compare host-alphavirus interactions at the immune response level in vivo in animal models through a novel viral-centric approach. Preliminary data of the lab has shown a differential adaptive immune response polarization between two alphaviruses and identified, via in vivo comparative multiOmic approaches, a set of candidate host factors potentially responsible for the phenotype. The project will entail a close characterization of these host factors and their role in the viral life cycle as well as the modulation of the immune response of small animal model to these viruses. In addition to multi-Omics approaches (including single-cell and spatial), protein-protein interactions, microscopy, functional genomics, viral reverse genetics and CRISPR Cas9 gene editing will be some of the tools used to investigate this viral hijacking and understand the host-viral interplay. Animals models available in the lab include mice and zebrafish. Downstream of characterization will aim to validate these targets in small preclinical models for subsequent drug discovery in the A*STAR ecosystem. Throughout the project, close collaborative work within A*STAR ID Labs as well as other institutes throughout Singapore and overseas will be used to leverage expertise for high impact studies.

Position Available: Research Fellow (Engineering/Physics)
The laboratory of Yijie Shen at the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences is seeking to hire a research fellow with a solid theoretical background in optical angular momentum, particularly in vortex light fields, who has also conducted relevant research in this area. The research fellow will focus on two main aspects: 1) theoretical research on optical transverse angular momentum, and 2) the generation, measurement, and application of light fields carrying angular momentum or certain polarization states in long pulses.
Optical transverse angular momentum represents a cutting-edge topic in the field of optics. In the past three years, it has garnered significant attention and extensive research within the scientific community, with related work frequently published in top-tier journals. However, the theoretical understanding of optical transverse angular momentum is still in its infancy. The current theoretical frameworks remain unclear and lack solid foundations, with considerable discrepancies in its definition and calculation. Therefore, advancing its theoretical research is crucial, and this is expected to become a prominent research direction in optics in the coming years.
Additionally, experimental work on vortex light fields can also be pursued. While the generation and study of light beams carrying longitudinal angular momentum are already well-established, research on the generation and measurement techniques for light pulses carrying both longitudinal and transverse angular momentum is still in the early stages. Moreover, exploring potential applications of these light fields remains an open frontier. Theoretical studies involving optical vortices in pulses and ultrafast optics require further development to establish a comprehensive research framework.
Key Responsibilities:
Conduct theoretical research on optical transverse orbital angular momentum, focusing on its definition and calculation
Develop methods for numerical simulation for optical longitudinal and transverse angular momentum or generating and measuring light fields carrying longitudinal and transverse angular momentum. Investigate the practical applications of these light fields, such as using them as detection signals in various scenarios (e.g., interactions with different material interfaces)
Work on the generation and measurement of long pulses with modified power spectrum and explore their applications in the field of communications
Publish high-quality research papers to contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the field
Job Requirements:
PhD degree in Engineering, Physics or related areas, with focus on optical angular momentum, optical vortex
Experience in theoretical research for vortex beams, vector vortex beams and longitudinal/ transverse orbital angular momentum
