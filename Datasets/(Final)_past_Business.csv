The Job
Spend time with your cross functional team. Together you'll try to understand the business goals of your project and, often, meet the stakeholders to redefine the problem statement.
Once you know where you're going, it's time to tackle the behemoth tech systems and complexities of the product and process of a bank. Your product manager will become your best friend. You'll message the tech lead more than your parents. You'll get a crash course in finance and payments.
We want to hire people who have opinions, believe in their ideas and are willing to fight for them. But we also want people who can recognise when a better argument or solution is put before them.
All of us participate in user testing, and so will you.
The Talent
Strong visual design skills and understand and have demonstrated good use of typography, color usage, visual hierarchy and visual balance in your book of work or portfolio
Great taste in design
Ability to visually communicate your ideas using animation & motion. Using tools like Figma and Protopie for transitions is not a challenge for you. (Knowledge of other tools that you may use are not necessary but welcome)
High attention to detail and be able to avoid oversight
Understand the needs to designers, engineers & know how to contextualise problems
Ability to prioritise, work independently and drive outcomes
Enough curiosity to stay savvy about industry and UX trends.
Confidence in your ideas and the ability to communicate them clearly.
Follow through—when built, your designs actually look and work like they should. You monitor products after launch and are ready to suggest improvements.
Experience in the fintech industry is an added advantage.
