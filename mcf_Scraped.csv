Project Title: Sn-based alloy-carbon nanoassemblies for sodium-ion batteries using plasma-based sustainable technologies (RI 7/22 RSR )
Project Introduction: Sustainability of lithium-ion batteries in long run, as major energy storage system, is not possible due to limited resource of lithium and increasing cost. Hence, focus on sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is increasing as sodium is abundantly available at much lower cost. The biggest challenge for SIBs is to find suitable anode material with appropriate sodium voltage storage, large reversible capacity, and high structural stability. Moreover, the synthesis process of anode material needs to be cost, time and energy efficient. It is hypothesized: (i) Carbon (GraphiticCarbon/Graphene/GrapheneQuantumDots = GC/G/GQD) encapsulated nanostructured-tin (ns-Sn), i.e. GC/G/GQD@ns-Sn, as anode in SIBs will accommodate volume change, prevent formation of excessively thick SEI layer, and avoid pulverization leading to enhanced capacity, capacity retention and stability. (ii) Plasma based strategy, as against wet chemical approach, can provide sustainable environmentally friendly synthesis of GC/G/GQD@ns-Sn with better energy-, time- and cost- efficiency. Specific aims are: (i) to develop and optimize the plasma based sustainable synthesis of integrated hybrid 3D GC/G/GQD@ns-Sn anode in core-shell configuration, and (ii) to develop and test industry relevant SIB prototype using the most optimized carbon-Sn combination and bench mark its capacity, efficiency, cycling and stability. Synthesis of ns-Sn onto suitable 3D foam substrate using plasmas will be achieved first. Afterwards, GC/G/GQD will be encapsulated onto ns-Sn using plasma strategy to form GC/G/GQD@ns-Sn. Structural, compositional, morphological properties of electrode material along with their detailed electrochemical characterization and performance analysis will be conducted to achieve best battery performance.
The Research Fellow hired for this project at NIE will work on synthesis and optimization of GC/G/GQDs@ns-Sn as anode electrode material using plasma based dry process. He/she will also be responsible for the characterization (SEM, EDX, XRD, RAMAN, TEM, XPS etc) and performance evaluation (using battery tester and electrochemical workstation) of the anode electrode material.
Requirements:
Essential
A PhD in Physics or Engineering with a strong background in low-temperature processing and synthesis of materials.
Strong experience in development, operation and optimization of various plasma devices and associated diagnostics.
Strong experience on energy storage materials for sodium ion batteries.
Expert on using various material characterization facilities SEM, EDX, XRD, RAMAN, TEM, XPS etc
Expert on using electrochemical workstation and battery tester with experience on electrochemical performance analysis of batteries.
Good written and verbal communication skills with evidence of proven writing skills from research papers and research reports.

Project Title: Sn-based alloy-carbon nanoassemblies for sodium-ion batteries using plasma-based sustainable technologies (RI 7/22 RSR )
Project Introduction: Sustainability of lithium-ion batteries in long run, as major energy storage system, is not possible due to limited resource of lithium and increasing cost. Hence, focus on sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is increasing as sodium is abundantly available at much lower cost. The biggest challenge for SIBs is to find suitable anode material with appropriate sodium voltage storage, large reversible capacity, and high structural stability. Moreover, the synthesis process of anode material needs to be cost, time and energy efficient. It is hypothesized: (i) Carbon (GraphiticCarbon/Graphene/GrapheneQuantumDots = GC/G/GQD) encapsulated nanostructured-tin (ns-Sn), i.e. GC/G/GQD@ns-Sn, as anode in SIBs will accommodate volume change, prevent formation of excessively thick SEI layer, and avoid pulverization leading to enhanced capacity, capacity retention and stability. (ii) Plasma based strategy, as against wet chemical approach, can provide sustainable environmentally friendly synthesis of GC/G/GQD@ns-Sn with better energy-, time- and cost- efficiency. Specific aims are: (i) to develop and optimize the plasma based sustainable synthesis of integrated hybrid 3D GC/G/GQD@ns-Sn anode in core-shell configuration, and (ii) to develop and test industry relevant SIB prototype using the most optimized carbon-Sn combination and bench mark its capacity, efficiency, cycling and stability. Synthesis of ns-Sn onto suitable 3D foam substrate using plasmas will be achieved first. Afterwards, GC/G/GQD will be encapsulated onto ns-Sn using plasma strategy to form GC/G/GQD@ns-Sn. Structural, compositional, morphological properties of electrode material along with their detailed electrochemical characterization and performance analysis will be conducted to achieve best battery performance.
The Research Fellow hired for this project at NIE will work on synthesis and optimization of GC/G/GQDs@ns-Sn as anode electrode material using plasma based dry process. He/she will also be responsible for the characterization (SEM, EDX, XRD, RAMAN, TEM, XPS etc) and performance evaluation (using battery tester and electrochemical workstation) of the anode electrode material.
Requirements:
Essential
A PhD in Physics or Engineering with a strong background in low-temperature processing and synthesis of materials.
Strong experience in development, operation and optimization of various plasma devices and associated diagnostics.
Strong experience on energy storage materials for sodium ion batteries.
Expert on using various material characterization facilities SEM, EDX, XRD, RAMAN, TEM, XPS etc
Expert on using electrochemical workstation and battery tester with experience on electrochemical performance analysis of batteries.
Good written and verbal communication skills with evidence of proven writing skills from research papers and research reports.
