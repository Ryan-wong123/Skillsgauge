Project Title: Sn-based alloy-carbon nanoassemblies for sodium-ion batteries using plasma-based sustainable technologies (RI 7/22 RSR )
Project Introduction: Sustainability of lithium-ion batteries in long run, as major energy storage system, is not possible due to limited resource of lithium and increasing cost. Hence, focus on sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is increasing as sodium is abundantly available at much lower cost. The biggest challenge for SIBs is to find suitable anode material with appropriate sodium voltage storage, large reversible capacity, and high structural stability. Moreover, the synthesis process of anode material needs to be cost, time and energy efficient. It is hypothesized: (i) Carbon (GraphiticCarbon/Graphene/GrapheneQuantumDots = GC/G/GQD) encapsulated nanostructured-tin (ns-Sn), i.e. GC/G/GQD@ns-Sn, as anode in SIBs will accommodate volume change, prevent formation of excessively thick SEI layer, and avoid pulverization leading to enhanced capacity, capacity retention and stability. (ii) Plasma based strategy, as against wet chemical approach, can provide sustainable environmentally friendly synthesis of GC/G/GQD@ns-Sn with better energy-, time- and cost- efficiency. Specific aims are: (i) to develop and optimize the plasma based sustainable synthesis of integrated hybrid 3D GC/G/GQD@ns-Sn anode in core-shell configuration, and (ii) to develop and test industry relevant SIB prototype using the most optimized carbon-Sn combination and bench mark its capacity, efficiency, cycling and stability. Synthesis of ns-Sn onto suitable 3D foam substrate using plasmas will be achieved first. Afterwards, GC/G/GQD will be encapsulated onto ns-Sn using plasma strategy to form GC/G/GQD@ns-Sn. Structural, compositional, morphological properties of electrode material along with their detailed electrochemical characterization and performance analysis will be conducted to achieve best battery performance.
The Research Fellow hired for this project at NIE will work on synthesis and optimization of GC/G/GQDs@ns-Sn as anode electrode material using plasma based dry process. He/she will also be responsible for the characterization (SEM, EDX, XRD, RAMAN, TEM, XPS etc) and performance evaluation (using battery tester and electrochemical workstation) of the anode electrode material.
Requirements:
Essential
A PhD in Physics or Engineering with a strong background in low-temperature processing and synthesis of materials.
Strong experience in development, operation and optimization of various plasma devices and associated diagnostics.
Strong experience on energy storage materials for sodium ion batteries.
Expert on using various material characterization facilities SEM, EDX, XRD, RAMAN, TEM, XPS etc
Expert on using electrochemical workstation and battery tester with experience on electrochemical performance analysis of batteries.
Good written and verbal communication skills with evidence of proven writing skills from research papers and research reports.

Project Title: Sn-based alloy-carbon nanoassemblies for sodium-ion batteries using plasma-based sustainable technologies (RI 7/22 RSR )
Project Introduction: Sustainability of lithium-ion batteries in long run, as major energy storage system, is not possible due to limited resource of lithium and increasing cost. Hence, focus on sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is increasing as sodium is abundantly available at much lower cost. The biggest challenge for SIBs is to find suitable anode material with appropriate sodium voltage storage, large reversible capacity, and high structural stability. Moreover, the synthesis process of anode material needs to be cost, time and energy efficient. It is hypothesized: (i) Carbon (GraphiticCarbon/Graphene/GrapheneQuantumDots = GC/G/GQD) encapsulated nanostructured-tin (ns-Sn), i.e. GC/G/GQD@ns-Sn, as anode in SIBs will accommodate volume change, prevent formation of excessively thick SEI layer, and avoid pulverization leading to enhanced capacity, capacity retention and stability. (ii) Plasma based strategy, as against wet chemical approach, can provide sustainable environmentally friendly synthesis of GC/G/GQD@ns-Sn with better energy-, time- and cost- efficiency. Specific aims are: (i) to develop and optimize the plasma based sustainable synthesis of integrated hybrid 3D GC/G/GQD@ns-Sn anode in core-shell configuration, and (ii) to develop and test industry relevant SIB prototype using the most optimized carbon-Sn combination and bench mark its capacity, efficiency, cycling and stability. Synthesis of ns-Sn onto suitable 3D foam substrate using plasmas will be achieved first. Afterwards, GC/G/GQD will be encapsulated onto ns-Sn using plasma strategy to form GC/G/GQD@ns-Sn. Structural, compositional, morphological properties of electrode material along with their detailed electrochemical characterization and performance analysis will be conducted to achieve best battery performance.
The Research Fellow hired for this project at NIE will work on synthesis and optimization of GC/G/GQDs@ns-Sn as anode electrode material using plasma based dry process. He/she will also be responsible for the characterization (SEM, EDX, XRD, RAMAN, TEM, XPS etc) and performance evaluation (using battery tester and electrochemical workstation) of the anode electrode material.
Requirements:
Essential
A PhD in Physics or Engineering with a strong background in low-temperature processing and synthesis of materials.
Strong experience in development, operation and optimization of various plasma devices and associated diagnostics.
Strong experience on energy storage materials for sodium ion batteries.
Expert on using various material characterization facilities SEM, EDX, XRD, RAMAN, TEM, XPS etc
Expert on using electrochemical workstation and battery tester with experience on electrochemical performance analysis of batteries.
Good written and verbal communication skills with evidence of proven writing skills from research papers and research reports.

The School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (SPMS) at NTU Singapore hosts research and education activities in two divisions: Division of Mathematical Sciences (MAS) and Division of Physics and Applied Physics (PAP). MAS covers diverse topics ranging from pure mathematics to the applications of mathematics in cryptography, computing, business, and finance. PAP covers many areas of fundamental and applied physics, including quantum information, condensed matter physics, biophysics, and photonics. Over the years, SPMS has attracted talented individuals from around the world and Singapore to join as scientific leaders and researchers.
Key Responsibilities:
To develop and setup the technique fs laser direct-write and optical cavity integration.
To setup and align optical beamlines/setups for home-built micro-transient optical spectroscopy experiments.
To conduct micro-transient absorption spectroscopy studies on the measurements of carrier diffusion length.
To perform data analysis and data interpretation of micro-transient optical spectroscopy experiments independently.
To assist the principal investigator with the writing of research papers.
Job Requirements:
Candidate must possess at least a Master Degree in Physics or Chemistry or Chemical Sciences.
In addition to Master degree, candidate must possess at least a BSc 1st Class/2nd Class Upper Honours Degree in Physics or Chemistry or Chemical Sciences or nanomaterials and nanotechnology.
Candidate will be tasked to prepare perovskite nanomaterials and conduct ultrafast optical spectroscopy studies on them.
He/She is also required to perform data analysis and data interpretation.
Excellent knowledge in chemical synthesis, optics, photophysics of semiconductors, charge and quasi-particle dynamics, charge transfer mechanisms, femtosecond lasers, and femtosecond laser spectroscopy is essential. A written and oral test of the candidate’s technical competency of femtosecond lasers, photophysics concepts, and ultrafast optical spectroscopy basics will be conducted during the interview.
Excellent knowledge in the optical characterization of semiconductor materials (including nanostructures) which includes transient spectroscopy (pump-probe, time-resolved PL), and material characterizations (XRD, AFM, GIWAXS/GISAXS).
Critical Requirement: Candidate must have a Minimum 3 Years of Research Experience in Ultrafast Lasers and Ultrafast Laser Spectroscopy of semiconductor materials.
Critical Requirement: Candidate must also have a Minimum 3 Years of Research Experience in the study of photophysics in semiconductor systems.
