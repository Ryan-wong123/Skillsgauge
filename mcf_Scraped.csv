MyrLabs is an A*STAR spin-off that creates cutting edge hardware and algorithms. The MyrLabs team consists of driven and multi-disciplinary engineers dedicated to bringing game-breaking solutions for our partners by innovating at the PCB, firmware, and software levels. We work on problems that academia fears to, cannot, or will not address. These are problems that are difficult and require multi-disciplinary efforts. Our approach focuses on the use of non-mainstream techniques to spark creativity and to solve problems in ways that are not seen before.

Job Brief
We are looking to hire a Country Coordinator to assist the Senior Management Team in opening, building up, and operating an overseas office.

You will be supported by MyrLabs staff who will fly in from Singapore on 1- or 2-week stints. The initial workload will be light and ramp up over the next 1-2 years as the team expands and more local staff are hired. We are open to flexible part-time work, but request that you remain contactable during work hours especially when a MyrLabs team is in-country. If you do not already speak Bahasa Indonesia, you are expected to learn it and achieve conversational fluency within 6 months.
Our ideal candidate has:
· Demonstratable congeniality and is comfortable with Singaporean working culture
· Proven experience in managing and executing projects and/or technology deployments
· Proven business acumen in solving business problems and soliciting new problems
· Career stints in government and/or R&D roles

Responsibilities
1. Act as the primary representative of MyrLabs in-country with a focus on building and maintaining relationships with key stakeholders
2. Work with the Senior Management Team to design and execute strategies that are suitable and friendly to the local environment
3. Oversee the day-to-day operations, ensuring high standards of delivery across all projects and services in compliance with local regulations within manageable operational risks
4. Foster, mentor, and guide MyrLabs staff (mostly Millennials and Gen-Z’ers) whenever they operate in-country

The initial workload will be light and ramp up over the next 1-2 years as the team expands and more local staff are hired. We are open to flexible part-time work, but request that you remain contactable during work hours especially when a MyrLabs team is in-country. If you do not already speak Bahasa Indonesia, you are expected to learn it and achieve conversational fluency within 6 months.
Our ideal candidate has:
· Demonstratable congeniality and is comfortable with Singaporean working culture
· Proven experience in managing and executing projects and/or technology deployments
